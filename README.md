# Multi-class-classifier-using-CNN-for-detecting-COVID-19-X-Ray-images

In this study, three CNN models are proposed to learn the classifying approach for the patientsâ€™ current health 
conditions based on their chest X-ray images. One is my own defined CNN model, and the other two are popular 
transfer learning models, InceptionV3, and ResNet50. Data augmentation is also applied to deal with the lack of 
sample data, so as to support deep neural network models. The overfitting problem is solved by freezing some 
redundant layers in the deep network. Performance results show that pre-trained ResNet50 yields the highest accuracy 
among all the models on both training set and validation set, and also get 82% accuracy on the Kaggle test set.
